        **🔧 Easy Integration**

        Simple installation and integration with existing Python workflows.

Getting Started
===============

Install pyGMM using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install pygmm

Quick example:

.. code-block:: python

   import pygmm

   # Create a scenario
   scenario = pygmm.Scenario(mag=6.5, dist_rup=20, v_s30=760)

   # Initialize a ground motion model
   gmpe = pygmm.CampbellBozorgnia2014()

   # Calculate ground motion
   mean, std = gmpe(scenario)
